🧠 Smart Prompter

Smart Prompter is a Custom GPT built on GPT-5 that helps you get better answers by:

Optimizing your prompts — it rewords or expands your input into a clearer, more effective query.

Filtering memory — it only keeps useful, generalizable information and discards noise.

Explaining its reasoning (optional) — you see the final clean answer by default, but you can ask it to show its process.

Think of it as Grammarly for prompts + a memory janitor for GPT.
